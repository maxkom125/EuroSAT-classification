# EuroSAT-classification

Image Classification

**Task**: Train a ML model on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset. 

**Dataset**: The dataset contains 64x64 RGB images from Sentinel-2. You can find references to the dataset here - https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT 

Deliverables - 
1. Training [Jupyter notebook]: Include all steps from loading the dataset, to saving the model and evaluation metrics. 
2. Inference [Jupyter notebook]: Notebook to perform inference, generate and save classification results. Use 20 sample images from the dataset. 
3. Constraints of the current solution [200 words] (use bullet points) + Potential improvements to the solution [200 words] (use bullet points). 

Constraints of the current solution:

* Fixed hyperparameters: The current implementation uses fixed hyperparameters such as the learning rate and momentum values for the optimizer. These hyperparameters may not be optimal for the given dataset and may need to be tuned for better performance.

* Limited data augmentation: The current implementation uses only basic data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping, rotation and random cropping. More advanced data augmentation techniques such translation, and color jittering could be used to further improve the model's performance.

* Limited model architecture: The current implementation uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model with a linear classifier on top. While ResNet18 is a powerful model, there are many other architectures that could be used to achieve better performance on the given dataset. Additionally, the linear classifier may not be sufficient for more complex datasets with more classes.

* Limited classes: The current implementation does not cover unexpected (new) classes.

* Limited error handling: The current implementation does not have robust error handling. For example, if the dataset directory or any of the required files are missing, the code will raise an error. Better error handling could be implemented to provide more informative error messages to the user.

* Limited documentation: The current implementation lacks sufficient documentation. While the code is relatively easy to read and understand, more detailed documentation could help users who are not familiar with the codebase to use and modify the code more easily.

Some potential improvements to the current solution include:

* Hyperparameter tuning: The current solution uses default values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, momentum, and batch size. Tuning these hyperparameters using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization may improve the performance of the model.
* Model architecture: The current solution uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model with the last fully connected layer replaced by a new one. Using different pre-trained models or modifying the architecture of the fully connected layer may improve the model's performance.
* Data augmentation: The current solution applies only basic data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping, rotation and random cropping. Adding more data augmentation techniques such as translation and color jittering may improve the model's performance.
* Ensemble learning: The current solution trains a single model on the dataset. Using ensemble learning techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking may improve the model's performance by combining the predictions of multiple models.
* Early stopping: The current solution trains the model for a fixed number of epochs. Adding early stopping based on a validation metric may prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.
* Regularization: The current solution uses only cross-entropy loss as the loss function. Adding regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization or dropout may prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.
* Training on larger dataset: The current solution uses a relatively small dataset. Training the model on a larger dataset may improve its performance on the target task.
* Fine-tuning: The current solution replaces only the last fully connected layer of the pre-trained model. Fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model or some of its layers may improve the model's performance on the target task.
* Using a different optimizer: The current solution uses the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. Using a different optimizer such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad may improve the model's performance.
