# EuroSAT-classification

Image Classification

**Task**: Train a ML model on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset. 

**Dataset**: The dataset contains 64x64 RGB images from Sentinel-2. You can find references to the dataset here - https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT 

Deliverables - 
1. Training [Jupyter notebook]: Include all steps from loading the dataset, to saving the model and evaluation metrics. 
2. Inference [Jupyter notebook]: Notebook to perform inference, generate and save classification results. Use 20 sample images from the dataset. 
3. Constraints of the current solution [200 words] (use bullet points) + Potential improvements to the solution [200 words] (use bullet points).
